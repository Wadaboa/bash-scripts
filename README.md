## Scripts
### dockerize
Script used to automate some tasks relative to docking/undocking the system to/from home/work.\
This script is a daemon, invoked when a specific USB device is connected/disconnected (In this case, this device is the external keyboard **Keyboard -- QuickFire XT**).\
So, whenever the **plugging event** happens, the script does the followings:
* If there's my external keyboard connected, changes keyboard layout from US to IT and enables bluetooth
* If there's an active ethernet connection, shuts down wifi
* If there are two connected external monitors, sets a dual wallpaper

And whenever the **unplugging event** happens, the script does the followings:
* If there isn't my external keyboard connected, changes keyboard layout from IT to US and disables bluetooth
* If there isn't an active ethernet connection, turns on wifi
* If there aren't two connected external monitors, sets a single wallpaper

The wallpapers are defined in the `assets` folder. The single monitor wallpaper is named `one.jpg`, while the dual monitor wallpapers are named `two_left.jpg` and `two_right.jpg`.

#### Dependencies
The script depends on the following libs:
* **xkbswitch** (https://github.com/myshov/xkbswitch-macosx)
* **blueutil** (https://github.com/toy/blueutil)
